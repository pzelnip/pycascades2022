## Meet & Greet with PSF D&I workgroup

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/3HKZTJ/>

> Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world,
> meaning that along with this growth the Python community has continued to
> expand, in every continent around the globe. While this growth has been
> exciting, it has also brought new challenges and opportunities to improve our
> global community. Through this panel, we would like to address those
> challenges and understand our community better.

## Supporting the George Floyd Protests in Portland: Demonstrations, Legal Support, and Django Apps

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/CZRPCJ/>

> Portland’s protests following the murder of George Floyd involved thousands of
> people. Providing bail and legal support to those arrested at the protests
> required a massive amount of volunteers, resources, and an incredibly
> hard-working Django app.

## Python’s tale of concurrency

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/WEYYJG/>

> Python is underrated when it comes to concurrency. The main aim of the talk
> would focus on exploring the general concept of concurrency and how we can
> utilise those concepts to write Python programs that are more scalable and
> more efficient in terms of I/0 bound operations. From the threading module and
> its limitations, to the asyncio module with its async and await keywords. We
> will look into different types of concurrent programming techniques available
> in Python though the major focus would be on the asyncio module, exploring
> best practises and common pitfalls while using asyncio.

## Building Elegant API Contracts: From Zero to Hero

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/ESCJLQ/>

>Learn how one can write efficient APIs with high-quality API specifications
>using Open API and RAML specs to create API contracts and achieve a better
>experience using the API with more reliable unit tests and increased response
>consistency.

## Cyber Security Investigations with Jupyter Notebooks

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/RF3L8D/>

> upyter notebooks are growing in popularity among CyberSec analysts. For threat
> hunting and incident investigations, notebooks give you flexibility not found
> in most Security Operations Center (SOC) toolsets.
>
> However, threat hunting requires specialized tools, analytics and
> visualizations that aren't part of the typical data science libraries. We'll
> show some of the features of the MSTICPy CyberTools library that we built to
> address these gaps.

## How (Not) to Start a Python User Group

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/9KJWWL/>

> Starting a local Python User Group is hard. Keeping it running month after
> month is even harder. As a Python User Group organizer, I've had my fair share
> of mess ups.
>
> In this talk, we'll examine some ways not to run your own Python User Group
> based on my own experiences as an organizer. By looking back at my own
> missteps, we'll determine some best practices for getting your own User Group
> off the ground. By the end of the talk, you'll be well equipped to run your
> User Group long-term. Come laugh and learn as we journey through my meetup
> misadventures and prepare you for your own.

## Invisible Walls: Isolating Your Python

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/YLBZLQ/>

> Stop building projects that only "work on my machine", Learn how to isolate
> your python application by executing in an isolated, reproducible environment
> that extends beyond the code you write.

## Literature Text Translation and Audio Synthesis using AI Services

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/FP87MV/>

> Ever wanted to read your favourite literature book or poetry but language is a
> barrier? Worry not! Enjoy the world literature in your preferred language
> along with audio book with just a click of a button. "Literature Love" uses AI
> services to translate and generate audio format for literature texts

## Tests as Classifiers

<https://pretalx.com/pycascades-2022/talk/UVFAMG/>

> The reason to write, and run, tests on the code is to detect bugs before the
> code is being used by the customer. Too often, this purpose is forgotten when
> deciding how, and what, to test. What makes a good test? What makes a good
> test-suite? How can you measure it?
>
> By modeling tests as a "classifier", where the label is "buggy" or "not
> buggy", the general theory of classification can be applied. The basics of the
> theory, such as precision, recall, and F-score, will be explored, as well as
> how it applies to test suites. Specific techniques for measuring test quality,
> using tools such as mutation testing, tracing, and CI systems, will be
> presented.
